        “What an astonishing thing a book is. It’s a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you’re inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of
        years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic."

      Re-imagine the future and potential of learning technologies. We are designing a mixed-reality tool that optimizes our experience learning from printed books. Our brains capabilities for attention and deep thinking are diminishing due to our increasingly
      screen-based lives, and we envision this tool as part of the solution to that problem. <br> <br>Just as an expert human tutor might, the technology we propose will understand both the book you are reading and your brain's behavior while learning,
      guiding you through rich meaning making and discovery. In addition to conversing with your AI tutor, we see great opportunity in the realm of overlaid augmented content being produced by our developers, by book publishers, and by a community of
      users.

      How do we create subtle interactive experiences with the analog printed word? How do we help preserve a place for books in our increasingly screen-based futures? This concept seeks to explore the intersection between current mixed reality technology and
      the timeless experience of learning from books. We see this not as a animation-oriented feature that ‘brings to life’ a literary moment, but rather as a potential educational tool.

      We explored the many departments at NYU and the faculty in those departments that might be relevant to our project, then started doing research in those same fields, specifically: education, psychology, and neuroscience. <br><br> Kenzo (Psychology-new

      or enhance cognition? <br> - Teaching for metacognition could dramatically alter students’ deficiencies. <br><br> Juan Jose (Education & AR) <br><br> - Can we blend formal and informal learning spaces to create an environment of engaging continuous
      learning? <br> - The potential of trans-media storytelling, creating dynamic, team-based, collaborative problem solving, participatory environments that encourage exploration, examination, reasoning, debate and negotiation – vital skills in the
      modern workplace and that of the future. <br><br> Daniella (Neuroscience) <br><br> - How information flows among broadly distributed brain regions involved in visual, phonological, and language processing to support reading? For optimal learning
      to occur, the brain needs conditions under which it is able to change in response to stimuli (neuroplasticity) and able to produce new neurons (neurogenesis). The most effective learning involves recruiting multiple regions of the brain for the
      learning task. These regions are associated with such functions as memory, the various senses, volitional control, and higher levels of cognitive functioning. “Reading is fascinating because it is a uniquely human skill. tacognitive skill (Dinsmore

      <strong>Schools</strong> <br> a. Group / classmates analytics - teacher POV shows realtime student's attention, like sims. <br> b. Teacher interaction mode - teacher can take action based on analytics - dashboard. <br> c. Connect the dots. <br>      d. Reading ability test literacy. <br>

      How interactive should this tool be? We met with NYU professors from computer science to education design, all of whom stress the importance of exploration for enabling students to best engage with their material.
      <br><br> Basically, there are two forms of thinking: divergent, where we follow a specific line of thought, and convergent - where we connect concepts. The brain is primarily a prediction machine, it learns best from another human being or interaction.
